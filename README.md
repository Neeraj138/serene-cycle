# SereneCycle

> Note: Currently, the cudis api provided in the docs isn't functional. So, I've created some mock data at the same endpoints but on my own express server and using this data for prototyping. Whenever the cudis ring api becomes available, it would be integrated to the application (just a change in base url in env variable).

**SereneCycle** is a health and wellness app designed to help women track their menstrual cycles and overall well-being. Pairs with the **Cudis Ring** to provide personalized insights and recommendations based on health data such as heartbeat, sleep, and steps, along with daily symptom tracking. Provides food recommendations too based on your location! So, never miss your local cuisine!

## Key Features
- **Cycle Tracking**: Monitor your menstrual cycle and phases.
- **Cudis Ring Integration**: Data like heartbeat, sleep, and step count.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Get smart workout and nutrition suggestions based on your data.
